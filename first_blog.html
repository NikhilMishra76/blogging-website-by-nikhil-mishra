        Reflecting on your family’s past? Well, then Diwali in Odisha is ideal for you. During Diwali, Odisha builds a light way in the dark. Tall bamboo poles are put up outside homes, with an earthen pot tied high on the pole, through a rope. Inside each pot is a glowing lamp, adding its lustre to the bamboo shoots. The reason behind this ritual is poignant. The locals in Odisha believe that lighting the dark will help their ancestor’s spirits find their way to heaven. Burning the sticks also encourages the ancestors to shower their blessing on the family before departing.</p>
