    <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Lovely Professional University (Punjab), today, where he inaugurated world’s largest science meet ‘106th Indian Science Congress (ISC)-2019’ and delivered the inaugural address. Feeling happy to be in the company of great scientists and scholars from across India and abroad, PM Modi congratulated ISCA for selection of the theme of the event this year – ‘Future India: Science and Technology’. Reflecting on it, he shared that India’s true strength will be in connecting its science, technology and innovation with its people.
        Recalling great Indian scientists including J.C. Bose, C.V. Raman and more for their services to the people through minimum resources under maximum struggle, he underlined that through modern science India is transforming its present and working continuously to secure its future. Recalling two former PMs for their joint slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kissan, Jai Vigyan” given to the country, he laid utmost importance to research in the country by further adding to it “Jai Anusndhan”. He stressed that the pursuit of science can be fulfilled through generation of profound and disruptive knowledge, and then use of that for socio-economic good.

    <p>Mentioning about various achievements of Indian science in 2018, including production of aviation grade biofuel; DivyaNayan – a machine for visually impaired; inexpensive devices for diagnosis of cervical cancer, dengue; real-time landslide warning system; he said that strong pathways to commercialization, are needed to leverage our Research & Development achievements, through industrial products. He also called for research, which is a fusion of Arts and Humanities, Social Science, Science and Technology.
        “Research for research sake does not help. We are building an ecosystem to commercialise innovations to benefit the farming community and common people. We have set up more incubation centres in the last four years than in the last 40 years,” added Mr Modi. Scientific fraternity has to come out with a way of linking scientific advances to societal development, he said, adding that more scientific work is needed in the areas of affordable healthcare, agricultural productivity, food processing and related fields.
