        <hr>
        <p>
        Every year on August 15, India celebrates its Independence Day. This is the day on which India gained its independence from British rule in 1947. It is a day to celebrate our freedom and unity as a nation.
        
        On Independence Day, Indians all over the world come together to celebrate. The day begins with the hoisting of the Indian flag at government offices, schools, and other public places. This is followed by a speech by the Prime Minister of India. The speech is typically about the progress that India has made since independence and the challenges that the country still faces.
        
        After the speech, there are cultural performances and parades. People wear traditional Indian clothing and distribute sweets to each other. It is a day of joy and celebration for all Indians.
        
        The importance of Independence Day
        Independence Day is an important day for India because it marks the beginning of a new era in the country's history. Before independence, India was a colony of Great Britain. This meant that the British government controlled India's political, economic, and social affairs.
        
        After independence, India became a free and sovereign nation. The Indian people were finally able to govern themselves and make their own decisions. Independence Day is a reminder of this freedom and the sacrifices that were made to achieve it.
        
        Independence Day and our unity as a nation
        Independence Day is also a day to celebrate our unity as a nation. India is a diverse country with people of different religions, languages, and cultures. However, on Independence Day, all Indians come together as one nation.
        
        We celebrate our shared heritage and our common goal of building a better future for India. Independence Day is a reminder that we are all Indians and that we are stronger when we are united.
