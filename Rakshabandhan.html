        Rakshabandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated on the full moon day of the month of Shravan (July-August). The festival is a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a rakhi, a sacred thread, on their brother's wrist. This symbolizes the sister's love and protection for her brother, and the brother's promise to protect his sister.
